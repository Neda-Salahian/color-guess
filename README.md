# GUESS THE COLOR GAME

![](./image/JavaScript-RGB-color-guessing-game.png)

Coding a color guessing game with JavaScript is quite straightforward:

- The intrerface is already prepared in `index.html`
- Write your code in `script.js`

1. You build a game where the player will see a single **RGB value** for a color
2. The player has to **click** on a _color_ they think matches the RGB value displayed
3. Use the `#message` container to display the guessing result to the user

You can easily add more features to the game to make it more difficult.

For example, you could limit the number of guesses or give the player three “lives”. With every wrong guess, they would lose one, and the game would be over when they run out of lives.
